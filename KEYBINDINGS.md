This file is a guide to the keybindings of this flake, and the design of it. WIP

## What am I focusing
The idea is to have the keybindings set in the way that speed and ease of memorization are the priority.
## Apps
Firefox, mainly managing tabs and quick search.
Terminal, easy text manipulation and multiple windows and aliases for common stuff.
Code editors, using vim motions mainly, this is where I want to practise first.
WM, easy window manipulation with the most common ones being locked into a specific slot.

## Layers
So, there are a few "layers" for the keybindings, the rules are:
- Vim motions are prioritized, so there should be no overlapping of actions between this and other features
- Keybindings shall be organized into two layers, system and application, with no overlapping either.
